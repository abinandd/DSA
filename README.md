# DSA
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with basic problems and solutions.



Given an array of integers and a target, return the index if found, else -1.

Count how many times a given element appears in an array using linear search.

Find the minimum or maximum element in an array using linear search.

Check if an array contains duplicates (using linear search).

Given a string, use linear search to check if a character exists in it.

Search for the first and last occurrence of a number in an array.

Search in an unsorted array of objects (like {id, name}) by matching a field (say id).

🔹 Binary Search (Beginner)

⚠️ Reminder: Binary Search works only on sorted arrays.

Write a binary search function to find an element in a sorted array.

Given a sorted array, return the index of the target, or -1 if not found.

Find the index of the last occurrence of a target in a sorted array.

Find the position to insert a number in a sorted array (like bisect).

Search for a character in a sorted string using binary search.

Find the smallest element greater than or equal to a given key (Ceil).

Find the largest element smaller than or equal to a given key (Floor).
